# GradeADreamer

[[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09850)] [Project Page Coming Soon...]

A high-quality text-to-3D generation with low occurrence rate of the Multi-face Janus Problem and fast generation time.

## Resource Requirements

The model was tested on a single RTX 3090 GPU, achieving a generation time of around 30 minutes per asset. We measured the memory peak, and it requires at least 16 GB of GPU VRAM to execute the entire pipeline.

## Environment Setup
```bash
# from yml file
conda env create --file=environment.yml
conda activate GradeADreamer

# Gaussian Splatting
pip install git+https://github.com/ashawkey/diff-gaussian-rasterization

# simple-knn
pip install git+https://github.com/camenduru/simple-knn/

# MVDream
pip install git+https://github.com/bytedance/MVDream

# nvdiffrast
pip install git+https://github.com/NVlabs/nvdiffrast/

# tiny-cuda-nn
pip install git+https://github.com/NVlabs/tiny-cuda-nn/#subdirectory=bindings/torch

# kiuikit
pip install git+https://github.com/ashawkey/kiuikit
```

## Run (Entire pipeline)
```bash
./run.sh -opt astro
```

## Run each stage separately
```bash
# Stage 1 : Create Prior Point Clouds [MVDream + SDS]
python main_prior.py --config configs/astro/prior.yaml

# Stage 2 : Gaussian Splatting Optimization [Stable Diffusion + SDS]
python main_gs.py --config configs/astro/gs.yaml

# Stage 3 : Texture Optimization [Stable Diffusion + SDS]
python main_appearance.py --config configs/astro/appearance.json
```

## Export to VDO
```bash
kire logs/astro/astro_appearance/dmtet_mesh/mesh.obj --save_video logs/astro/astro_output_vdo.mp4 --wogui
```

## Evaluation

You will just need to move the needed gif representations of models to evaluate (360¬∞ around the 3D model) in the `eval/images` folder and arrange them by folders inside like `eval/images/astro`, also make sure to respect the name of the associated config for automatic search.

```
python eval.py
```
